======================================================================================

This page introduces the new Odoo Coding Guidelines. Those aim to improve the quality of the code (e.g. better readability of source) and Odoo Apps. Indeed, proper code eases maintenance, aids debugging, lowers complexity and promotes reliability.

These guidelines should be applied to every new module, and new developpment. These guidelines will be applied to old module only in case of code refactoring (migration to new API, big refactoring, ...).

**Warning**

These guidelines are written with new modules and new files in mind. When modifying existing files, the original style of the file strictly supersedes any other style guidelines. In other words, never modify existing files in order to apply these guidelines, to avoid disrupting the revision history of each line. For more details, see our pull request guide.
