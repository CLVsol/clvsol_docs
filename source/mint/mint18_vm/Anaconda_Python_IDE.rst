**Disabling the linter:**

    There is people that doesnâ€™t care about linting or they just use another plugin to do it, they can completely deactivate this feature setting the anaconda_linting as false in the anaconda or project configuration (/home/openerp/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Anaconda/Anaconda.sublime-settings).
